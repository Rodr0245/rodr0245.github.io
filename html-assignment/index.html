			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hey there, I'm Nicolas Rodriguez, a 24-year-old from Colombia with a passion for cinematography and website and app design. Ever since I was very <sub>little</sub>, I've been captivated by the art of storytelling through moving images. With my camera in hand, I strive to create visually stunning and emotionally impactful pieces that leave a lasting impression. </p>

			<p>My creative journey doesn't stop there. I'm also deeply passionate about web design and development, languages such as <abbr>HTML</abbr> and <abbr>CSS</abbr> really interest me. I find joy in crafting seamless digital experiences that not only look visually appealing but also provide smooth functionality. Whether it's designing eye-catching websites or developing user-friendly apps, I'm constantly honing my skills and seeking new ways to push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.</p>

			<h3>A quote from a movie I really enjoy: </h3>
			<blockquote>	
				<p>There are the hands that make us, And there are the hands that <em>guide us.</em></p>
